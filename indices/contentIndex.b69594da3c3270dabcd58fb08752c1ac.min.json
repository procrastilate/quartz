{"/":{"title":"the rock garden ðŸª¨ðŸŒ¿","content":"\n### Welcome, perhaps again, to my little corner of the internet :-)\n\n\u003e For those of you familiar with the blog, I ultimately decided I didn't want to pay a monthly fee to host a blog I never update, so here we are hosting a digital garden myself via the aptly named Obsidian and Quartz. \n\nFor those of you that don't know me, or are new around here, hello! I'm Lily, a soon-to-be graduate of geology in the UK. I have somehow, despite my university's best efforts to make things difficult, managed to maintain and in fact advance a rampant enthusiasm for rocks and telling people about them, which is part of what brings us here.  \n\nFirst I want to give a quick explanation of what a digital garden is, then let you explore the *maybe* 3 pages that I've probably actually finished. Luckily for me, a digital garden is supposed to be a long-term work in progress, so at least I have an excuse this time.\n\nAs far as my understanding goes, a digital garden is a space for an ever-growing collection (or garden) of thoughts and ideas. It sits somewhere between a blog, a notebook and a personal wiki. The special thing is how notes can be connected - by topic, keywords, by literally anything - and how that gets turned into a map of contents: a graph showing every note in the garden, and how they all link to each other in different ways. You can treat it like a blog, and read things chronologically, or you can just jump around with linked notes and see where you end up. \n\nSo that's what this is - my very own (rock) garden. A lil' place of organised chaos for random blog posts, notes on the characteristics of different minerals, a rant about how I can't quite seem to focus on the right thing. \n\nI hope you like it here :-)\n\nLily\n\n\n# Where to start\n- [[notes/Something New|Something New]]\n- [[notes/A Little Introduction to Mineralogy]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-11T10:04:48.443390829Z","tags":[]},"/notes/A-Little-Introduction-to-Mineralogy":{"title":"Intro to Mineralogy","content":"# Introduction to Mineralogy\nMinerals are defined as naturally occurring solids that have a specific chemical composition and crystal structure. \n\n# Glossary\n\n## Chemical Group\nA minerals chemical group relates to its chemical composition, where minerals are grouped based on the elements they contain.\n\n## Chemical Composition\nThe chemical formula of a mineral represents the combination and proportion of the different elements that make it up.\n\n## Crystal System\nThe crystal system of a mineral relates to the specific arrangement of atoms within its crystal structure, which determines the shape and characteristics of the crystals it forms. There are seven general crystal systems including cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, hexagonal, rhombohedral, monoclinic and triclinic.\n\n## Crystal Habit\nCrystal habit refers to the characteristic shape or arrangement of crystals as they naturally grow, which is influenced by a minerals atomic structure and environmental conditions.\n\n## Mohs Hardness\nThe Mohs hardness scale ranks minerals from 1 to 10 on their relative hardness or resistance to scratching. Objects with known hardness can be used to help identify unknown minerals.  Your fingernail, for example, has a hardness of 2.5 (and a knife 5.5) meaning that any mineral scratched by your fingernail (or knife) has a lower hardness.\n\n## Colour\nThe colour of a mineral is tempting to use in its identification, but is not to be relied upon. The colour of a mineral can be affected by impurities or alteration, and many minerals vary significantly in colour.\n\n## Lustre (or Luster)\nThe lustre of a mineral refers to the way it reflects light on its surface. There are a number of words to describe lustre, including metallic, vitreous (glassy), pearly, silky, or dull. A mineral with metallic lustre is reflective like metal; a mineral with vitreous luster appears similar to glass, like quartz.\n\n## Transparency\nOpaque minerals do not allow any light to pass through them. Translucent minerals allow some light through  them. Transparent minerals easily allow light to pass through them and can be fully seen through.\n\n## Streak\nMineral streak refers to the colour of the powdered form of a mineral - generally identified when it is scraped across a tile of unglazed ceramic or â€˜streak plateâ€™.\n\n## Cleavage\nCleavage describes the tendency of a mineral to break along smooth planes of weakness. Cleavage is defined by its quality - i.e. how smoothly it breaks. A mineral with perfect cleavage leaves smooth flat surfaces when it breaks, and one with poor cleavage leaving smooth surfaces but dominantly rough rough surfaces.\nCleavage may be in several directions, with a mineral that easily splits into flat sheets having cleavage in 1 direction and a mineral that breaks into cubes having cleavage in three directions at right angles (cubic cleavage). \n\n## Fracture\nMinerals that have equal strength in all directions (no planes of weakness) do not exhibit cleavage, but instead fracture. Fracture describes the way in which some minerals break irregularly. Quartz, for example, does not break along cleavage planes and has conchoidal fracture, where it breaks with curved surfaces similar to glass.\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-11T10:04:48.443390829Z","tags":["mineralogy","geology"]},"/notes/A-New-Era":{"title":"A New Era","content":"\nSome exciting things have happened since I last wrote a blog post, so here's one to describe and reflect on them :)\n\nAfter a long and continually uncertain four years, I have finished university. The whole thing has been pretty anticlimactic unfortunately, but I'm relieved that it's over. It's now a case of waiting to see if it all paid off - a moment my subconscious is hell-bent on playing out. I was woken this morning out of a dream in which my dissertation supervisor told me I'd failed and said my cross sections really let me down. I've come a long way in trying not to think about what ifs and worst case scenarios, but it seems that hasn't extended to my sleep, so I think we'll just have to ride it out until my results are released on the 14th of August.\n\nStill, despite my brain's best efforts to cause unnecessary anxiety, I'm glad it's all done and I'm proud of myself for finally believing in and acting on a 'done not perfect' philosophy. It may have taken the entirety of my degree to figure out, but we got there - I submitted some 'okay' work for the sake of time and energy and I don't regret it. \n\nThere has been so much uncertainty throughout my degree as to whether I would be able to finish university, and I am so pleased to be able to say that I've done it - that, despite the odds, I kicked ass and learned rocks ('kick ass, learn rocks' poster, anyone?). It is without question that many of you reading this have had an impact on that in some way or another, and I am so incredibly thankful for the difference our little corner of the internet has made in my life. Thank you. I truly, honestly, am not sure that I'd have been able to do it without your support.\n\nAnother - even more surreal, infinitely more exciting, very much not anticlimactic - thing has happened since I last posted too: Hollie and I have moved into our new home. We're still unpacking, and we barely have internet, but things are coming together - one room at a time. Sure, finishing university was unexpected, but this? Absolutely ridiculous :')\n\nI am now living in the period of my life I have feared the most. All the uncertainty of wanting to work, not knowing how, not knowing where, not knowing how I can manage it without burning out. Not knowing where to start, or how to be better in interviews, how to find balance in spoon budget, how to commute (can I commute?), etc., etc. Thankfully, it looks much different to how I'd imagined it. I'd always imagined moving back to my mum's, struggling to find work on account of being in the middle of nowhere, and slowly but surely closing myself off and watching all that hopelessness come back and kick *my* ass - obviously not preferable and very uncool. Instead, I'm less so in the middle of nowhere, much better at talking to new people (thanks, twitch), very much wanting to kick ass, and feeling loved and supported by friends, family and the most wonderful partner literally on the planet (thanks, twitch). I have never been more equipped than I am right now to get the balls rolling and find something I can make work. I just.. don't really know how to do that, but we'll get there. I feel moments of hopelessness, sure, but for the most part I'm looking forward to moving that much further toward independence and feeling like I, at least a little bit, have my shit together.\n\nSo, now that university's done, we have some new goals. \n\nI finally have the literal and mental space to do the things I want to - so that's what we're going to do. I'm going to get back to streaming as soon as we have internet to play some games as well as do some work-finding coworking. I'm going to keep making things - finish some projects I started but felt like I couldn't spend time on because I needed to be pRodUcTive. Make some geology stuff, release the merch maybe, write more blog posts, who knows? Definitely send the thank you cards from the Guide Dogs stream.\n\nI am going to try to remind myself that, even though it feels like everything needs to happen right here right now in terms of finding work and paying bills, I have some time. It doesn't have to consume my every waking  moment - not yet. I am going to remind myself that spending time on things I'm passionate about isn't a waste of time, and I'm going to do my best to believe it. I'm going to try and trust that the odds of figuring something out are greater than zero. \n\nWhile there may be lots of uncertainty right now about what happens next, I am certain that there's hope of figuring stuff out. I won't let it detract from the wonderful things that've happened this month. University is over and I am home and, in the same way that those have felt so beyond possibility, we got there in the end - and I intend for this new kinda wonky period of my life to go the same way.\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-11T10:04:48.443390829Z","tags":["blog post"]},"/notes/Pyrite":{"title":"Pyrite","content":"\n![Pyrite](/notes/images/Pyrite.png)\n\n| Property                                                                                                                       | Value                                                                          | \n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| [Chemical Group](https://procrastilate.github.io/quartz/notes/A-Little-Introduction-to-Mineralogy/#chemical-group)             | Sulfides                                                                       |\n| [Chemical Composition](https://procrastilate.github.io/quartz/notes/A-Little-Introduction-to-Mineralogy/#chemical-composition) | Iron sulfide, FeS\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e                                                  |\n| [Crystal System](https://procrastilate.github.io/quartz/notes/A-Little-Introduction-to-Mineralogy/#crystal-system)             | Isometric (cubic)                                                              |\n| [Crystal habit](https://procrastilate.github.io/quartz/notes/A-Little-Introduction-to-Mineralogy/#crystal-habit)               | Cubic, faces may be striated, but also frequently octahedral and pyritohedral. |\n| [Mohs hardness](https://procrastilate.github.io/quartz/notes/A-Little-Introduction-to-Mineralogy/#mohs-hardness)               | 6 - 6.5                                                                        |\n| [Colour](https://procrastilate.github.io/quartz/notes/A-Little-Introduction-to-Mineralogy/#colour)                             | Pale brass-yellow to golden-yellow                                             |\n| [Lustre](https://procrastilate.github.io/quartz/notes/A-Little-Introduction-to-Mineralogy/#lustre-or-luster)                   | Metallic                                                                       |\n| [Transparency](https://procrastilate.github.io/quartz/notes/A-Little-Introduction-to-Mineralogy/#transparency)                 | Opaque                                                                         |\n| [Streak](https://procrastilate.github.io/quartz/notes/A-Little-Introduction-to-Mineralogy/#streak)                             | Greenish-black                                                                 |\n| [Cleavage](https://procrastilate.github.io/quartz/notes/A-Little-Introduction-to-Mineralogy/#streak)                           | Poor                                                                           |\n| [Fracture](https://procrastilate.github.io/quartz/notes/A-Little-Introduction-to-Mineralogy/#fracture)                         | Conchoidal                                                                     |\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-11T10:04:48.443390829Z","tags":["mineralogy","sulfides","pyrite"]},"/notes/something-new":{"title":"Something... new?","content":"\n\u003eâ€˜I have no idea what Iâ€™m doing, but Iâ€™m excited to find outâ€™ is how I\nwould summarise my general thought process right now. It presents a general trend of thinking that I have only really felt in fleeting moments, following one of many small and sudden waves of inspiration about all of the possible things I could do or make.\n\nI struggle a lot with having too many thoughts all at once, both positive and negative, and I am finding myself particularly troubled by the uncertainty, but also excitement, of so many things and choices and possibilities right now. Thankfully, despite my brainâ€™s apparent affinity for moving through ideas very quickly, all at once, and with enough force to cause physical pain, some ideas are regular visitors to my brain and better yet some are even consistently acted upon.\n\n_Procrastilate_ is a name that Iâ€™ve been using since 2016, the name itself coming simply from the fact that â€˜procrastinateâ€™ was unavailable and I thought _procrastilate_ sounded okay. First, procrastilate was my tumblr blog or â€˜studyblrâ€™ created to help get me through my a-level exams while suffering from seemingly relentless mental health issues* which I will not go into here.\n\nMy studyblr was active over several years - all three of my college years and at least two into university - and served as a space for me to share, I suppose, my somewhat wonky journey through education. I tried as best I could to put forward a â€˜realisticâ€™ view of productivity, always feeling to some degree that there were certain aspects of â€˜productivity contentâ€™ inaccessible for myself.\n\nGetting through that part of my life was far more about survival than it was about doing the absolute best I could in the perfect circumstances. It was doing everything that I could to stay as far away from burning out as possible. It was finding success in the small things; feeling good about studying for a little bit on any given day; recognising that any progress is good progress; giving myself a fucking break - not comparing myself to others with different brains and different lives, not measuring my worth on how productive I am.\n\nOver time I became much worse at taking _aesthetic_ study notes and making posts and being active in the community, and after so many years and so many wonderful people met as a result, my tumblr was mostly laid to rest along with the era of my life that justified its beginnings.\n\nProcrastilate is now the name I go by on Twitch where, on my birthday in the midst of a COVID lockdown and following one of my aforementioned waves of inspiration, I decided to begin streaming on twitch as a way to step out of my overly restricted comfort zone.\n\nFollowing a whole load of life stuff and a revisit from our good friend â€˜burnoutâ€™, I was struggling to sit down and do university work, and figured that even though nobody would see it, I would _have_ to study if I was sat in front of a camera saying that I was studying. So I did, and I kept doing it.\n\nAnd now, here we are.\n\nThe date of this post, my 24th birthday, marks 2 years since I started on twitch, and I cannot emphasise the difference that time has made throughout so many facets of my life.\n\nIn the next year, I will be finishing my degree, hopefully moving myself and the Colonel to Hydro, finding work for the first time, and figuring out how to be a functioning person without the prescribed routine offered by education. Itâ€™s a lot and I am terrified, but I am so fucking excited.\n\nIâ€™m at a point in my life I couldnâ€™t even entertain the idea of 5, even 10, years ago. I am so close to finishing university with a degree in a subject I love, something even just a few years ago was nearly out of the question.\n\nIâ€™ve had lots of thoughts recently about where I want to direct my energy once some of itâ€™s freed up post-uni, and it turns out thereâ€™s lots of things:\n\n- I want to put more time into streaming. Iâ€™m excited to play more games, talk more shit, create more, and do more of the things I love about streaming. Iâ€™m excited to transition away from almost exclusively co-working streams and move towards more variety content.\n- I want to create more. I want to spend more time on design and illustration, and maybe do something with it. I have ideas about what that might be, and I just ask that you watch this space. I canâ€™t promise or commit to anything, but I hope these ideas I have are something that sticks and that you get to see the results of it.\n- RELEASE THE BLOODY CUBE CLUB MERCH\n- Write more.\n\nThat leads us to this post.\n\nToday, the 13th of February, (in true procrastilate fashion) marks the beginning of something new - a blog of ramblings, tips, things I like, things I donâ€™t - an immortalised record of me just talking shit.\n\nI donâ€™t know that I have things worth saying, or anything â€˜differentâ€™ to say, or that Iâ€™ll be any good at writing it. I do know that, despite all of the things that have worked against me, I made it. Iâ€™m alive, and Iâ€™m as close to thriving as Iâ€™ve ever been. I am passionate about so many things and I love being able to share that with you. I love hearing about your passions, too, and I just am so grateful to be virtually surrounded by people that are so enthusiastic about what they care about. I love that.\n\nSo, as we move into this new stage of my life full of new things, I want to write about the things that got and keep me here. I want to write about the things that Iâ€™m working on or looking forward to, and the things - big and small - that make my functioning easier as a very anxiously disposed neurodivergent person. Unfortunately for you, that also includes my special interests so prepare yourself for some geology content.\n\nThere is little expectation that many of you will be interested in engaging with this blog, but in case you are - this is it.\n\n**Welcome:-)**\n\n*which I thankfully learned much later were largely a result of my undiagnosed autism spectrum disorder.\n\n![](/notes/images/somethingnew.png)\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-11T10:04:48.45539089Z","tags":["blog post"]}}
