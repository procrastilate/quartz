Some exciting things have happened since I last wrote a blog post, so here's one to describe and reflect on them :)

After a long and continually uncertain four years, I have finished university. The whole thing has been pretty anticlimactic unfortunately, but I'm relieved that it's over. It's now a case of waiting to see if it all paid off - a moment my subconscious is hell-bent on playing out. I was woken this morning out of a dream in which my dissertation supervisor told me I'd failed and said my cross sections really let me down. I've come a long way in trying not to think about what ifs and worst case scenarios, but it seems that hasn't extended to my sleep, so I think we'll just have to ride it out until my results are released on the 14th of August.

Still, despite my brain's best efforts to cause unnecessary anxiety, I'm glad it's all done and I'm proud of myself for finally believing in and acting on a 'done not perfect' philosophy. It may have taken the entirety of my degree to figure out, but we got there - I submitted some 'okay' work for the sake of time and energy and I don't regret it. 

There has been so much uncertainty throughout my degree as to whether I would be able to finish university, and I am so pleased to be able to say that I've done it - that, despite the odds, I kicked ass and learned rocks ('kick ass, learn rocks' poster, anyone?). It is without question that many of you reading this have had an impact on that in some way or another, and I am so incredibly thankful for the difference our little corner of the internet has made in my life. Thank you. I truly, honestly, am not sure that I'd have been able to do it without your support.

Another - even more surreal, infinitely more exciting, very much not anticlimactic - thing has happened since I last posted too: Hollie and I have moved into our new home. We're still unpacking, and we barely have internet, but things are coming together - one room at a time. Sure, finishing university was unexpected, but this? Absolutely ridiculous :')

I am now living in the period of my life I have feared the most. All the uncertainty of wanting to work, not knowing how, not knowing where, not knowing how I can manage it without burning out. Not knowing where to start, or how to be better in interviews, how to find balance in spoon budget, how to commute (can I commute?), etc., etc. Thankfully, it looks much different to how I'd imagined it. I'd always imagined moving back to my mum's, struggling to find work on account of being in the middle of nowhere, and slowly but surely closing myself off and watching all that hopelessness come back and kick *my* ass - obviously not preferable and very uncool. Instead, I'm less so in the middle of nowhere, much better at talking to new people (thanks, twitch), very much wanting to kick ass, and feeling loved and supported by friends, family and the most wonderful partner literally on the planet (thanks, twitch). I have never been more equipped than I am right now to get the balls rolling and find something I can make work. I just.. don't really know how to do that, but we'll get there. I feel moments of hopelessness, sure, but for the most part I'm looking forward to moving that much further toward independence and feeling like I, at least a little bit, have my shit together.

So, now that university's done, we have some new goals. 

I finally have the literal and mental space to do the things I want to - so that's what we're going to do. I'm going to get back to streaming as soon as we have internet to play some games as well as do some work-finding coworking. I'm going to keep making things - finish some projects I started but felt like I couldn't spend time on because I needed to be pRodUcTive. Make some geology stuff, release the merch maybe, write more blog posts, who knows? Definitely send the thank you cards from the Guide Dogs stream.

I am going to try to remind myself that, even though it feels like everything needs to happen right here right now in terms of finding work and paying bills, I have some time. It doesn't have to consume my every waking  moment - not yet. I am going to remind myself that spending time on things I'm passionate about isn't a waste of time, and I'm going to do my best to believe it. I'm going to try and trust that the odds of figuring something out are greater than zero. 

While there may be lots of uncertainty right now about what happens next, I am certain that there's hope of figuring stuff out. I won't let it detract from the wonderful things that've happened this month. University is over and I am home and, in the same way that those have felt so beyond possibility, we got there in the end - and I intend for this new kinda wonky period of my life to go the same way.
