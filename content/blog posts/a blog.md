> ‘I have no idea what I’m doing, but I’m excited to find out’ is how I would summarise my general thought process right now. It presents a general trend of thinking that I have only really felt in fleeting moments, following one of many small and sudden waves of inspiration about all of the possible things I could do or make.

I struggle a lot with having too many thoughts all at once, both positive and negative, and I am finding myself particularly troubled by the uncertainty, but also excitement, of so many things and choices and possibilities right now. Thankfully, despite my brain’s apparent affinity for moving through ideas very quickly, all at once, and with enough force to cause physical pain, some ideas are regular visitors to my brain and better yet some are even consistently acted upon.

_Procrastilate_ is a name that I’ve been using since 2016, the name itself coming simply from the fact that ‘procrastinate’ was unavailable and I thought _procrastilate_ sounded okay. First, procrastilate was my tumblr blog or ‘studyblr’ created to help get me through my a-level exams while suffering from seemingly relentless mental health issues* which I will not go into here.

My studyblr was active over several years - all three of my college years and at least two into university - and served as a space for me to share, I suppose, my somewhat wonky journey through education. I tried as best I could to put forward a ‘realistic’ view of productivity, always feeling to some degree that there were certain aspects of ‘productivity content’ inaccessible for myself.

Getting through that part of my life was far more about survival than it was about doing the absolute best I could in the perfect circumstances. It was doing everything that I could to stay as far away from burning out as possible. It was finding success in the small things; feeling good about studying for a little bit on any given day; recognising that any progress is good progress; giving myself a fucking break - not comparing myself to others with different brains and different lives, not measuring my worth on how productive I am.

Over time I became much worse at taking _aesthetic_ study notes and making posts and being active in the community, and after so many years and so many wonderful people met as a result, my tumblr was mostly laid to rest along with the era of my life that justified its beginnings.

Procrastilate is now the name I go by on Twitch where, on my birthday in the midst of a COVID lockdown and following one of my aforementioned waves of inspiration, I decided to begin streaming on twitch as a way to step out of my overly restricted comfort zone.

Following a whole load of life stuff and a revisit from our good friend ‘burnout’, I was struggling to sit down and do university work, and figured that even though nobody would see it, I would _have_ to study if I was sat in front of a camera saying that I was studying. So I did, and I kept doing it.

And now, here we are.

The date of this post, my 24th birthday, marks 2 years since I started on twitch, and I cannot emphasise the difference that time has made throughout so many facets of my life.

In the next year, I will be finishing my degree, hopefully moving myself and the Colonel to Hydro, finding work for the first time, and figuring out how to be a functioning person without the prescribed routine offered by education. It’s a lot and I am terrified, but I am so fucking excited.

I’m at a point in my life I couldn’t even entertain the idea of 5, even 10, years ago. I am so close to finishing university with a degree in a subject I love, something even just a few years ago was nearly out of the question.

I’ve had lots of thoughts recently about where I want to direct my energy once some of it’s freed up post-uni, and it turns out there’s lots of things:

- I want to put more time into streaming. I’m excited to play more games, talk more shit, create more, and do more of the things I love about streaming. I’m excited to transition away from almost exclusively co-working streams and move towards more variety content.
- I want to create more. I want to spend more time on design and illustration, and maybe do something with it. I have ideas about what that might be, and I just ask that you watch this space. I can’t promise or commit to anything, but I hope these ideas I have are something that sticks and that you get to see the results of it.
- RELEASE THE BLOODY CUBE CLUB MERCH
- Write more.

That leads us to this post.

Today, the 13th of February, (in true procrastilate fashion) marks the beginning of something new - a blog of ramblings, tips, things I like, things I don’t - an immortalised record of me just talking shit.

I don’t know that I have things worth saying, or anything ‘different’ to say, or that I’ll be any good at writing it. I do know that, despite all of the things that have worked against me, I made it. I’m alive, and I’m as close to thriving as I’ve ever been. I am passionate about so many things and I love being able to share that with you. I love hearing about your passions, too, and I just am so grateful to be virtually surrounded by people that are so enthusiastic about what they care about. I love that.

So, as we move into this new stage of my life full of new things, I want to write about the things that got and keep me here. I want to write about the things that I’m working on or looking forward to, and the things - big and small - that make my functioning easier as a very anxiously disposed neurodivergent person. Unfortunately for you, that also includes my special interests so prepare yourself for some geology content.

There is little expectation that many of you will be interested in engaging with this blog, but in case you are - this is it.

**Welcome:-)**
